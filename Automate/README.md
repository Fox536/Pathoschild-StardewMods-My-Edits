**Automate** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you place a chest
next to machines (like a furnace, cheese press, bee house, etc), and the machines will
automatically pull raw items from the chest and push processed items into it.

Automated machines will give you the same XP, achievements, and items you'd get for using them
directly.

### Advanced automation
A 'machine group' is any number of chests and machines connected together. Any chest or machine
placed adjacent to a chest or machine that's already in the group will be added to the group. You
can press `U` (configurable) to visualise machine groups.

If you add multiple chests to the same machine group, they'll all be used in the automation. Input
will be taken from all the chests, and output will be saved to chests in this order:
1. chests with 'output' in the name;
2. chests which already contain an item of the same type;
3. any chest.

### Factories
A 'factory' is just a machine group which produces a certain output. Here are some example factories.
You can increase production by just adding more machines.

* **Automatic crab pots**  
  A worm bin produces bait, which is fed into the crab pots, which harvest fish and recycle trash.
  The final products are stored in the chest.

* **Automatic refined quartz factory**  
  A crystalarium produces quartz, which is smelted into refined quartz, which is stored in the
  chest.

* **Automatic iridium mead factory**  
  A bee house produces honey, which is turned into mead, which is aged to iridium quality, which is
  stored in the chest.

* **Automatic iridium bar factory**  
  A statue of perfection produces iridium ore, which is smelted into bars, which are stored in the
  chest.

* **Semi-automatic iridium cheese factory**  
  Put your milk in the chest and it'll be turned into cheese, then aged to iridium quality, then
  put back in the chest.

## Configuration
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

setting           | what it affects
----------------- | -------------------
`Controls` | The configured controller, keyboard, and mouse buttons (see [key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Key_bindings)). You can separate multiple buttons with commas. The default value is `U` to toggle the automation overlay.
`AutomationInterval` | Default `60`. The number of update ticks between each automation cycle (one second is â‰ˆ60 ticks).
`VerboseLogging` | Default `false`. Whether to write more detailed information about what the mod is doing to the log file. This is useful for troubleshooting, but may impact performance and should generally be disabled.
