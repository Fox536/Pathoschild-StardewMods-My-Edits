**This mod is obsolete, since SMAPI 1.0+ moved debug mode into a separate mod.**  
<hr />﻿

**No Debug Mode** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which simply disables
SMAPI's `F2` debug mode, which can cause unintended consequences like skipping an entire season
_and automatically saving_, or teleporting into walls. (See [SMAPI issue #120](https://github.com/cjsu/SMAPI/issues/120).)

## Installation
1. Install [SMAPI](https://github.com/ClxS/SMAPI) (any version).
3. Install [this mod from Nexus mods](http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/593/).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Usage
This is a passive mod — it'll simply disable debug mode immediately after you enable it.

## Versions
1.0:
* Initial release.
